            <h2>2004 Saab 9-3</h2>
            <p>The first car that I purchased with my own money was a 2004 Saab 9-3. I bought this car in 2010 after graduating high school. I drove the Saab all throughout college, and for the first few years of my post-college life. Here are some of the best features: <br><br>
               - 4 cylinder turbo engine <br>
               - Combined fuel economy of 28 MPG <br>
               - Luxury finishes, such as leather seats <br><br>

            <h2>2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee</h2>
            <p>In 2016, I decided it was time to buy a new car. This time, I chose to go for an SUV. I found this 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee and instantly knew I had to have it! This is my current car and it is still going strong. So far, these are my favorite things about the Jeep: <br><br>
               - 4 wheel drive <br> 
               - Leather heated seats <br>
               - Towing and off-road capabilites <br><br>

            <h2>Mercedes-Benz G-Class</h2>
            <p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class (also known as the G-Wagon) is my ideal next car. However, with a base price of $124,500, it may be a while before I can afford one. It is nice to dream though! <br><br>
               I also find it fascinating that the G-Class was originally designed as a military vehicle, and now it has become a status of luxury. These days, you will see many celebrities and wealthy people driving these. <br><br>
